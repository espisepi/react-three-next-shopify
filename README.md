# react-three-next-shopify

Mix of:

- react-three-next template
- nextjs ecommerce shopify vercel official template
- remix-shopify-hydrogen official template (only to see graphql and queries things)
- next-teslo udemy course (to use local mongodb database instead of shopify backend)

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-r3f-app`](https://github.com/utsuboco/create-r3f-app)
